changing size for retina macs
	* Install my Firefox-addon Zoom Menu Elements (or install this file from source on github).
		Alternative: you can manually open a new tab about:config in Firefox and search for layout.css.devPixelsPerPx set this value to 2 or 1.5 as you wish to adjust the size of the Firefox icons
	* Install the Firefox-addon Fix for zoomed default-font to fix some issues with huge form elements on some pages (for ex. the login on reddit.com, ... see this question )
	* Additionally, (but not needed) install the Firefox addon NoSquint or Default Fullzoomlevel and chose in settings: default full page zoom level 120%.
