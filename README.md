dotty
=====

My dotfiles and configuration for profile, ssh, bash, zsh, git and vim. A handy install file will popuplate your home dir, also [Oh my zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) is recommended, if found you'll get my theme for that too.

## vi errors?
sudo apt-get install vim-nox
mkdir ~/.vim/backups

## don't have zsh?

### install zsh
sudo apt-get install zsh

### install oh-my-zsh cmd
curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh

### changed shell
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
exit

### reopen term and you should be all set
